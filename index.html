			<br>
			<p class="paragraph">My name is Alex Beck, a 14-year-old web developer. I know HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but I am hoping to learn PHP, SQL, etc. that would help with a backend. I have a pet tortoise, a dog, and a younger brother. I spend most of my time in my room playing video games (mainly Team Fortress 2). I haven't really done much with web development, other than my most recent project of making a website for my brother's bar mitzvah.</p>

			<h2 class="heading">My Inspiration</h2>
			<br>
			<p class="paragraph">Personally, I never really had an inspiration to get into web development. When I was younger, my uncle taught me how to use the very basics of HTML, and from there I thought myself the rest. Who really inspired me when I was younger was Bill Gates, just because of how successful he was. </p>

			<h2 class="heading">My Future Plans</h2>
			<br>
			<p class="paragraph">When I am older, I am hoping to become a web developer. I already know HTML, CSS, and Javascript (as you can see from above). My biggest project has to be making a website for my brother's bar mitzvah for people to RSVP to. My biggest dream would probably be to get into MIT (which is a VERY long shot, but it still is a dream). </p>
